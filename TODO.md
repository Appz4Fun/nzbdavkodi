# TODO - NZB-DAV Kodi Addon

Active backlog only. Completed work, old audit details, rejected designs, and long research notes live in git history.

Current addon version: see `repo/plugin.video.nzbdav/addon.xml`.

## Active Areas

Only two areas are active right now:

1. Close local/CI tooling gaps.
2. Keep a small bug-hunt seed list for the next focused review.

## Tooling Gaps

- Add a local Python 3.10 + 3.12 test matrix, or document why CI-only is enough.
- Add a true Python 3.8 import/runtime check, or keep relying on `.pylintrc` `py-version=3.8`.

## Future Bug-Hunt Seeds

- `_retry_original_range` may retry already-written byte boundaries.
- `HlsProducer.prepare()` may accept a file before ffmpeg has fully flushed it.
- Force-quit during submit can orphan an nzbdav job.
- Metadata filters may be too permissive when PTT cannot parse a release title.
- WebDAV 401/403/5xx handling should stay typed and visible, not collapsed to "not found".
- Session/window-property races should be reviewed before larger concurrency changes.
- NZBGet Smart Duplicates (#372) round 2: the poll tracks only the pick's NZBID, so if NZBGet fails over to a backup (a different NZBID under the shared DupeKey) the current resolve reports the pick's failure instead of following the backup to completion. Round 2 would track the whole DupeKey group / the newly-active NZBID rather than a single fixed NZBID. (Explicit DupeScores already made the submission order-independent, so the prior fast-pick timing race no longer applies — a late backup after a SUCCESS is put into history as a backup, not deleted.) Also consider widening "qualifying" from exact same-name to the same-content fallback identity (the DupeKey already spans the whole release, so different-named same-content releases would group correctly once they are included in the picker submission).

## Backburner

- nzbdav-rs provider retry/timeout tuning. Revisit only if fallback telemetry shows backend/provider behavior is still the limiting factor.

## Not Doing

- CoreELEC-from-source builds or PANI/piXBMC source patching.
- `send_200_no_range` default-flip work; fallback switching supersedes this track.
- Strict-contract/density-breaker rollout gates unless fallback code produces a new reason to revisit them.
